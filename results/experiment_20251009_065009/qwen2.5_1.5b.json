        "question": "Recommend some restaurants in Utown area.",
        "answer": "To recommend restaurants in the Utown area, I will consider factors such as seating capacity, operating hours, and halal food options available. Here are my recommendations:\n\n1. **Bismillah Biryani (MUSLIM OWNED)**\n   - Location: UTown Stephen Riady Centre (SRC)\n   - Seating Capacity: 410\n   - Term Time & Vacation Operating Hours: Mon-Fri: 11.30am — 7.30pm, Sat: 11.30am — 5.00pm\n   - Reasoning: This restaurant is a Muslim-owned establishment and offers halal options suitable for Utown residents.\n\n2. **Flavours @ UTown (HALAL FOOD OPTIONS AVAILABLE)**\n   - Location: UTown Stephen Riady Centre\n   - Seating Capacity: 700\n   - Term Time & Vacation Operating Hours: Mon-Sun, 8.00am-8.30pm\n   - Reasoning: Despite having a larger capacity, this restaurant is also halal and has flexible operating hours.\n\n3. **Hwang’s Korean Restaurant**\n   - Location: Town Plaza\n   - Seating Capacity: 114\n   - Term Time & Vacation Operating Hours: Mon-Sat, 10.30am-9.00pm\n   - Reasoning: While the capacity is lower compared to others, this restaurant offers Korean cuisine and flexible hours that could be convenient.\n\n4. **Mr Bean / Do Qoo (HALAL CERTIFIED)**\n   - Location: Town Plaza\n   - Seating Capacity: 125\n   - Term Time Operating Hours: Mon-Fri 7.30am — 9.00pm, Sat-Sat & PH 8.30am — 7.30pm\n   - Vacation Operating Hours: Mon-Fri, 8.30am — 7.30pm\n   - Reasoning: This restaurant meets the halal requirement and is open during both terms and holidays.\n\n5. **Triplets (HALAL CERTIFICATION)**\n   - Location: UTown Stephen Riady Centre (SRC)\n   - Seating Capacity: 8\n   - Term Time & Vacation Operating Hours: Mon-Fri: 9.00am to 9.00pm\n   - Reasoning: This is a smaller restaurant that caters specifically to halal requirements and has open hours similar to some of the larger restaurants.\n\n6. **Supersnacks (PENDING HALAL CERTIFICATION)**\n   - Location: Stephen Riady Centre\n   - Term Time Operating Hours: Mon-Fri, 11.00am-2.00am, Sat/Sun/PH, 6.00pm-2.00am\n   - Reasoning: This restaurant is still awaiting halal certification but operates during business hours which might be useful for students who want to eat during term time.\n\nThese recommendations cover a range of dining options from Muslim-owned establishments to those with larger seating capacities and flexible operating hours, ensuring you can find a suitable restaurant regardless of your dietary preferences or time constraints.",
