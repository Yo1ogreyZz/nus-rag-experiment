        "question": "What is the address of NUS Central Library?",
        "answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the address of NUS Central Library based on the given documents. Let me look through each document one by one.\n\nFirst, Document 1 provides the operating hours and some information about the library's location. It mentions that the address is 12 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119275. That seems straightforward. There are no other details there except for the building number and street name.\n\nNow, looking at other documents, like Document 2 and 3, they all talk about different locations near NUS Central Library but don't provide their addresses. They mention places such as Stephen Riady Centre, UTown, etc., with specific details like term times, seatings, and carpark info. However, these are not necessary for this question since it's only asking for the address.\n\nSince Document 1 clearly states the location as 12 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119275, that should be the answer. I don't see any conflicting information or additional details in other documents that would affect this response.\n</think>\n\nNUS Central Library is located at 12 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119275.\n\nAnswer: NUS Central Library is located at 12 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119275.",

        "question": "Recommend some restaurants in Utown area.",
        "answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to recommend restaurants in the Utown area based on the given documents. Let me start by understanding what's provided here.\n\nLooking at Document 1, it seems like there are several locations listed with different flavors and operating hours. For instance, Biryani is available at UTown Stephen Riady Centre, Halal Options are available as well. There are places like Hwang’s Korean Restaurant, Mr Bean/Do Qoo, Starbucks, Royals Bistro (HALAL Certified), Supersnacks, and Waa Cow. Each of these has different times during the day and weekends.\n\nDocument 2 seems to be a continuation or perhaps another list with similar information but maybe more detailed? It includes locations like Stephen Riady Centre, UTown SRC, Udon Don Bar, Triplets, and other locations. The times here are consistent across the documents except for Document 3 which might be an update or additional info.\n\nDocument 3 is about NUS Central Library's address. That seems less related to restaurant recommendations, so maybe I can ignore it unless there's something in the library information that relates to restaurants—unlikely. It just mentions the library's operating hours and a booking link for students.\n\nNow, looking at Document 1, each restaurant has its own details:\n\n1. Biryani (MUSLIM OWNED): Location, operating hours, flavors.\n2. Hwang’s Korean Restaurant: Same info as above but specific to Korean dishes.\n3. Mr Bean/Do Qoo (HALAL CERTIFIED): Again, same flavor offerings with HALAL options.\n4. Starbucks: Located at ERC, has daily 24-hour operating hours.\n5. Royals Bistro (HALAL Certified): Same as others.\n6. Supersnacks (PENDING): Only mentioned that it's pending certification.\n7. Waa Cow: Location and time.\n\nDocument 2 seems to have similar information but maybe a bit more detailed or different locations? For example, the Suppersnacks location is at Stephen Riady Centre with different times compared to Document 1, which might be a typo since both sayStephen Riady Centre. Wait, in Document 2 under Supersnacks it says \"Stephen Riady Centre\" but the operating hours are Sat/Sun/PH, 6pm-2am, while Document 1 lists it as 6:00pm to 2:00am with Sat/Sun/PH closed. That seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at other places:\n\n- Starbucks is in ERC (Education Resource Centre) with daily operating hours.\n- Udon Don Bar is at town Plaza with specific times, but not all days except Sunday?\n- The Royals Bistro is similar to the others but specific times for weekends and holidays.\n- Suppersnacks are pending certification, so I can't include them unless there's info on it. From what's provided in Document 1, Suppersnacks have no details except they need a certificate.\n\nSo, the key restaurants with available information are:\n\n- UTown Stephen Riady Centre (EST) with various flavors and different times.\n- Hwang’s Korean Restaurant\n- Mr Bean/Do Qoo\n- Starbucks\n- Royals Bistro (HALAL Certified)\n- Supersnacks (pending info)\n- Waa Cow\n\nConsidering the constraints, I need to provide personalized recommendations based on the operating hours and locations. The user wants specific places with different times, especially around weekends.\n\nLooking at Document 1:\n\n- UTown has several flavors except for the Hwang’s and Mr Bean/Do Qoo, which are specific. Starbucks is available daily. Royals Bistro has same flavor options but different hours.\n- Suppersnacks have a waiting list; since it's pending certification, I don't know much about them beyond availability once certified.\n\nSo, perhaps recommend UTown for its variety and locations, with Hwang’s and Mr Bean/Do Qoo as more specific options. Starbucks is a solid choice due to its consistent hours.\n\nWaa Cow and Suppersnacks are less clear on availability but can be recommended if certified.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided documents, here are some organized recommendations for dining in the Utown area:\n\n1. **UTown Stephen Riady Centre**:\n   - **Flavors**: Biryani (MUSLIM OWNED), Halal Options Available, Korean Restaurant, Royals Bistro (HALAL Certified).\n   - **Times**: \n     - Weekdays: Mon-Fri 11am-7pm; Sat-Sun & PH: 11am-5pm.\n     - Weekends: Sat-Sun/PH: 8am-9pm.\n\n2. **Hwang’s Korean Restaurant**:\n   - Open during specific times on weekdays, with a focus on Korean dishes.\n\n3. **Mr Bean/Do Qoo (HALAL CERTIFIED)**:\n   - Open throughout the day with HALAL certified options.\n\n4. ** Starbucks**:\n   - Located at the Education Resource Centre (ERC) with daily 24-hour operating hours.\n\n5. **Waa Cow**:\n   - **Note**: Availability may depend on a certification process pending in Document 1, but it's worth considering if certified.\n\n6. **Supersnacks**:\n   - Likely available once the certification is confirmed, with locations at Stephen Riady Centre and specific operating hours.\n\nThese recommendations cater to various time slots and dietary preferences, ensuring diverse dining experiences within Utown.",
