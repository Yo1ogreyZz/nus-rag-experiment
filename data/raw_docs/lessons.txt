It examines how particular edifices and places were understood, studied, and described, from within and without, under various kinds of discursive structures. They will be studied in the context of the historical moments of the island state as a colony, a nation-state and a global city. It covers architects and their works, unbuilt projects, lost buildings, and places - by consulting various sources of evidence.  The course will consult a variety of histories - institutional, professional, social-political - to develop a more robust narrative of the making of Singapore’s architecture within a landscape history.",

    "description": "This design studio focuses on the adaptive reuse of a modernist building in a traditional context. Traditions are often socially constructed and perceived differently across generational and cultural boundaries. Encountering rich cultural phenomena challenges our understanding of tradition and our own culture. While heritage is a valued part of the tradition, creating heritage often leads to a narrow and static view of tradition. This studio questions the typical approach of solely focusing on traditional forms in this context. It encourages the exploration of different ways to engage with tradition through literature, crafts, rituals, and worldviews. The goal is to propose a new use for the building within the urban and cultural context of the site while designing new facilities to support the functional program and enhance the heritage’s significance through adaptive reuse.",

The theme of analytics and informatics are explored throughout the course, and interrogated through four major blocks representing the key stages of culture: cultural production, experience and encounters, dissemination and interpretation in Asia. Students will be encouraged to think critically about the intersections of technology, stakeholders and culture. Prior computational knowledge is not required for this course.",

Visual analysis is accompanied by an investigation into the shifts in materials, technologies and contexts of display and consumption, which often expressed British control, native resistance and a desire for self-rule. The course also considers the role of British institutions, namely, art schools, archaeological surveys, museums and exhibitions in grooming art production and tastes; native projects and responses are unravelled simultaneously to understand East-West interactions.",

These testify to the creative, technological capacities of designers and communities of artists, as well as the ambitions and resources of patrons. They also reveal links within the region, and connections with India. The course cultivates methods for analysing the composition and formation of images, designs and built forms, gaining understanding of their symbolic import, and fostering insights into complex relationships between religious ideals and their artistic representations.",

It seeks to understand how genres in art history are sequenced, compared and analysed in the European tradition. The course also examines how art history evolves differently in Asian texts and Asian contemporary writing. These differences in the methods and approaches to art history provide diverse frameworks to appreciate art-production and consumption globally.",
